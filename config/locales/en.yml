    about:
      Speak to your neighbors.  Listen to what they have to say.  Only communicate with people within a clear geographic area.  Only follow topics that interest you.

      Have you ever wanted to stand on your front step and yell a message to all your neighbors?  Tell them that your cat is missing?  Find out if that strange car is really abandoned?  Ask to borrow a ladder?  Give away extra produce from your garden?

      Create an account, set your preferences, and begin connecting to your neighbors in a new, private, and direct way.
