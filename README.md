# Vicini [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/unsay/vicini.png)](https://travis-ci.org/unsay/vicini) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/unsay/vicini.png)](https://gemnasium.com/unsay/vicini) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/unsay/vicini.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/unsay/vicini)

Speak to your neighbors. Listen to what they have to say. Only communicate with
people within a clear geographic area. Only follow topics that interest you.

Have you ever wanted to stand on your front step and yell a message to all your
neighbors? Tell them that your cat is missing? Find out if that strange car is
really abandoned? Ask to borrow a ladder? Give away extra produce from
your garden?

This is Vicini.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of any kind, whether it is being involved with the 
project planning or development.

There are two [Trello](https://trello.com) boards we use.

#### [Product Roadmamp & Planning](https://trello.com/b/lxXO26Mo/vicini-planning)

This is the place where new ideas are gathered and requirements get written
down.

#### [Development](https://trello.com/b/nBdcZnqA/vicini-development)

This board is for developers with a clear order of priorities. Please feel free
to choose a feature in the queue, implment, and issue a pull-request, if it is 
not already assigned.
