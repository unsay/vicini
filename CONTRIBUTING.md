### Bug Reports

### Reporting a Bug

**A bug is a demonstrable problem** that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful. Thank You!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Use the [Trello search](https://trello.com/b/nBdcZnqA/vicini-development) &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has already been fixed &mdash; and try to reproduce it using the latest `master` branch in the repository.
3. Isolate the problem &mdash; **create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/)** with a live example.

A good bug report should be as detailed as possible, so that others won't have to follow up for the essential details.

Here's an example:

> Short and concise bug summary
>
> Description:
> Happens on Windows 7 and OSX. Seen with IE9, Firefox 19 OSX, Chrome 21, Flash 11.6 and 11.2
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Expected:
> (describe the expected outcome of the steps above)
>
> Actual:
> (describe what actually happens)
>
> `<url>` (a link to the reduced test case, if it exists)
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

### Pull Reqeusts

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Check for [existing issues](https://trello.com/b/nBdcZnqA/vicini-development) for duplicates and confirm that it hasn't been fixed already in the [master branch](https://github.com/unsay/vicini/commits/master)
2. Fork the repo, and clone it locally
3. `bundle install` in your newly created Vicini project and use your fork
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within a few days. We may suggest some changes or 
improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Use Ruby [style](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides, whatever is affected by your contribution
* Include any information that would be relevant to reproducing bugs, use cases for new features, etc.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
