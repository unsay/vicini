# Vicini

Speak to your neighbors. Listen to what they have to say. Only communicate with
people within a clear geographic area. Only follow topics that interest you.

Have you ever wanted to stand on your front step and yell a message to all your
neighbors? Tell them that your cat is missing? Find out if that strange car is
really abandoned? Ask to borrow a ladder? Give away extra produce from
your garden?

This is Vicini.
